# Photolabs
The PhotoLabs project is a website made with React where you can browse photos by varies topics and categories.  Weâ€™ve started the first step toward building this app by creating  isolated components, then we put those components together and made them work together. After that, we have connected it to an external source for pictures (API), and finally, we added some extra cool features using React.
